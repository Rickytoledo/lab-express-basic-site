              Ram Dass first went to India in 1967. He was still Dr. Richard
              Alpert, a prominent Harvard psychologist and psychedelic pioneer
              with Dr. Timothy Leary. He continued his psychedelic research
              until that fateful Eastern trip in 1967, when he traveled to
              India. In India, he met his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, affectionately
              known as Maharajji, who gave Ram Dass his name, which means
              “servant of God.” Everything changed then – his intense dharmic
              life started, and he became a pivotal influence on a culture that
              has reverberated with the words “Be Here Now” ever since. Ram
              Dass’ spirit has been a guiding light for three generations,
              carrying along millions on the journey, helping to free them from
              their bonds as he works through his own.

              Since 1968, Ram Dass has pursued a panoramic array of spiritual
              methods and practices from potent ancient wisdom traditions,
              including bhakti or devotional yoga focused on the Hindu deity
              Hanuman; Buddhist meditation in the Theravadin, Mahayana Tibetan,
              and Zen Buddhist schools, and Sufi and Jewish mystical studies.
              Perhaps most significantly, his practice of karma yoga or
              spiritual service has opened up millions of other souls to their
              deep, yet individuated spiritual practice and path. Ram Dass
              continues to uphold the boddhisatva ideal for others through his
              compassionate sharing of true knowledge and vision. His unique
              skill in getting people to cut through and feel divine love
              without dogma is still a positive influence on many people from
              all over the planet.

        the negative ones, as merely steps on the path, and to proceed.”

        righteousness and just be together.
